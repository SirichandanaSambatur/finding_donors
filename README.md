# finding_donors
In this project, supervised learning techniques are applied to the data that is collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. The data has been made suitable for modelling by applying various preprocessing techniques. Also, analyzed the various supervised learning techniques to find the most suitable one. Then optimized this learning technique to define the candidate solution model for the problem.

The project consists of three files-

1) census.csv: The project dataset.
2) finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where all the analysis for the project has been carried out.
3) visuals.py: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes.
